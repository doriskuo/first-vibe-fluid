# Project Rules & Collaboration SOP

## Commit & Push Policy
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Ask Always Before Commit**: Antigravity (AI) MUST NOT commit or push any changes without explicit prior approval from the user.
> 1. Propose the plan and changes.
> 2. Explain technical feasibility and impact.
> 3. Wait for user confirmation.
> 4. Only then proceed to `git commit` and `git push`.

## Visual Style Preservation
- **Irregular Edges**: The organic, liquid-like irregular boundaries are a core aesthetic requirement. Do not simplify them to smooth circles or other shapes without explicit instruction.
- **Fluid Motion**: Maintain the viscous, interactive feel of the fluid.
